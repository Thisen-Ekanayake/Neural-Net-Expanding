# Intelligent Neural Network Experiment

This repository explores a novel approach to neural networks: 
start small, train effectively, then expand systematically. Inspired 
by human learning, the model aims to generalize before scaling. 

> Note: This is an ongoing experiment. Details and results 
> will be updated as the project progresses.
